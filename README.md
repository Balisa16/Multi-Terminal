# Multi-Terminal
I created this project because I felt lazy to open terminals one by one, establish SSH connections, and type the desired commands for each target. Sometimes, this can be quite annoying when done repeatedly, especially during the drone trials I conduct. This program will load several terminals (Virtual Terminal Emulators) into one application. In addition, it establishes SSH connections and executes the desired commands with just a button press. This program is quite useful for me, especially during autonomous drone trials in outdoor environments, where sunlight interferes with our visibility of the monitor screen, and we don't have a good position to type in an outdoor setting.
